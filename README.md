# CCDC
Algorithm developed for Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) of land cover using all available Landsat data. Please contact Zhe Zhu (zhe.zhu@ttu.edu) at Department of Geosciences, Texas Tech University if you have any questions. 

CCDC Software is  available online now!

The Change Detection software is [here] (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4j3i5rtheujfjo1/AAA-3iH3iEgUxZeqMak7wNzRa?dl=0)

The Classification software is not provided at the moment, as it required training data to run the software.

Note that the output from CCDC will be thousands of Matlab files that contains all sorts of information for each time serie models as follows: 

1. "t_start": when the time series model gets started

2. "t_end": when the time series model gets ended
 
3. "t_break": when the first break (change) is observed

4. "coefs": the coefficients for each time series model for each spectral band

5. "rmse": the RMSE for each time series model for each spectral band

6. "pos": the position of each time series model (location)
 
7. "change_prob": the probability of a pixel that have undergone change (between 0 and 100)
 
8. "num_obs": the number of "good" observations used for model estimation

9. "category": the quality of the model estimation (what model is used, what process is used)
 
10. "magnitude": the magnitude of change (difference between model prediction and observation for each spectral band)

You need to extract those information from thousand of Matlab file to generate change maps or used as input for change detection. 

How to use the code:

1. Install Matlab Runtime Compilier version 8.1 for Linux 64-bit [here] (http://www.mathworks.com/supportfiles/MCR_Runtime/R2013a/MCR_R2013a_glnxa64_installer.zip)

2. Download all available Landsat CDR data (http://landsat.usgs.gov/CDR_LSR.php) and put them into BIP ENVI format. This including stacking spectral bands in sequence of Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, TIR, Fmask. Each image is in its sub-folders.

3. Run the standalone on many cores on your Linux clusters. The computing time for one path/row for 500~1000 images takes 1 hour to 12 hours for 600 cores running in parallel.

This algorithm has been applied to many parts of the world and you can see all located where it has been applied [here] (https://github.com/bullocke/Landsat-Database/blob/master/PRmap.geojson).
